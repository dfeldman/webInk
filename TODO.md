## Ideas for webInk apps
Just some brainstorming for other things that could be done with this.

### Simple Signage
A web based signage system. You can log in and change the contents of the sign at any time. Use it to display messages for your loved ones, or specials at a store or restaurant. 

### Calendar Reservation
The Calendar Reservation App connects to a calendar and shows a nicely formatted schedule of events for a room. It can be used for conference rooms, equipment, or other situations where you want to display current and upcoming events.

### Grafana Display
The Grafana Display shows a single graph from Grafana. This is useful for displaying system status. For example, you can show home server load in a place you can easily see it. 

### Transit Display
Shows an upcoming transit departure schedule. You specify the GTFS-RT feed for your transit provider. You can put it near your door so you know when to leave to catch the next bus. 

### Habit Streak
You get checkboxes each day for tracking habits of your choice, which can be checked off through a web app. For some people, having this visual reminder helps build consistency in developing positive routines.

### Mealie
Automatically shows your week's planned meals from a Mealie server. (If it can't connect to Mealie, it just displays a demo randomly-generated menu). Great for putting in the kitchen. 

### Health
Show your health data from Apple Health. For this to work, you must configure a paid iOS app called "Health Auto Export which syncs your health data to the server.
